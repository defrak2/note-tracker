# Note Taker


## Description

As a continual learner I wanted to create a note taking application where I can submit and save and delete notes at my own convenience. This application can save new notes, delete any specified notes and display them on the screen. 


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)

## Installation

Go to: https://note-tracker-fml4.onrender.com to see the application running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:


![landing page](/images/screenshot1.png)
![notes page with input for a new note](/images/screenshot2.png)
![notes page with new note displayed](/images/screenshot3.png)
